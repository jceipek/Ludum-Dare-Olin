WHAT IS IT?
===========

Tarassis is a a cross-platform, pysics-based platformer/puzzler created for the Ludum Dare 22 Game Jam, a 72 hour game creation competition.
Everything in the python version of the game (except for the programming libraries) was created in those 72 hours.

This is a branch for the SFML version, written in C++. It is currently much less developed than the original version, but should run much faster when
it is completed.

STORY
=====
You are a spaceman lost and alone on an empty, broken down spaceship and you need to find your way home. 


GAMEPLAY
========

(None of this is implemented in this version yet)
Control your character with the arrow keys and control the spaceship with the w, a, s , and d keys. Applying thrust to the spaceship can help you make otherwise impossible jumps,
but all other objects in the level are affected along with you.


CAN I PLAY IT YET?
=================
At the moment, if you want to play the game, check out the simple test level in the master branch, which is written in python and pygame.

STATUS
======
In active development.

INSTALLATION
============
This version requires the SFML library (version 2.0) and will eventually require Box2D. It can be compiled on Mac OS X using the included XCode project in the Tarassis folder.
Linux and Windows versions will be available when we get around to it.

RUNNING
=======
Pressing 'run' in the XCode project will launch the application. It is not possible to run the SFML version of the game in Linux or Windows at the moment.
