WHAT IS IT?
===========

Tarassis is a a cross-platform, pysics-based platformer/puzzler created for the Ludum Dare 22 Game Jam, a 72 hour game creation competition.
Everything in the game (except for the programming libraries) was created in those 72 hours.

STORY
=====
You are a spaceman lost and alone on an empty, broken down spaceship and you need to find your way home. 


GAMEPLAY
========

Control your character with the arrow keys and control the spaceship with the w, a, s , and d keys. Applying thrust to the spaceship can help you make otherwise impossible jumps,
but all other objects in the level are affected along with you.


CAN I PLAY IT YET?
=================
Kind of. During Ludum Dare 22, we created a simple test level to showcase the game mechanic, but there is currently no goal, no way to win or lose, and no puzzles.

STATUS
======
In active development.

INSTALLATION
============
You need python 2.6 or 2.7, a compatible version of pygame, and the pyBox2D physics engine module for python.


RUNNING
=======
Run the command:

        $ python main.py

in the root directory.
